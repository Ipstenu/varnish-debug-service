OVERVIEW:

This bucket - https://varnish-http-purge.objects-us-east-1.dream.io/ - was developed for
use by the VARNISH HTTP PURGE plugin, hosted on WordPress.org.

It is owned by Mika A. Epstein, and used for providing up to date compatibility checks on 
plugins and themes that may conflict with running a server based cache service (such as 
Varnish or Nginx).

PRIVACY:

When using this service, only non-personally-identifying transaction data is recorded 
or stored. IP addresses and the domain name of the website making the request may be 
recorded by the service, but there is no way to use that data to identify individuals or 
processes.

This service may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors. For instance, it may
document the volume of usage. It also may be used to prevent access to sites abusing the 
service (such as via a DDoS attack).

The service will not rent or sell this information to anyone. Other than to it's managing 
members, the service only discloses visitor information only when required to do so by 
law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect 
the property or rights of the service, third parties, or the public at large.
